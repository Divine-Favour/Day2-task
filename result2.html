                Whitney Elizabeth Houston (August 9, 1963 – February 11, 2012) was an
                American singer and actress. She was cited as the most awarded female
                artist of all time by Guinness World Records and remains one of the
                best-selling music artists of all time with 200 million records sold worldwide.
                Houston released seven studio albums and two soundtrack albums, all of
                which have been certified diamond, multi-platinum, platinum, or gold by the
                Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Her crossover appeal on
                the popular music charts—as well as her prominence on MTV, starting with her video
                for “How Will I Know”—influenced several female African-American artists.

                Houston began singing in church as a child and became a background vocalist while
                in high school. With the guidance of Arista Records chairman Clive Davis, she signed
                to the label at the age of 19. Her first two studio albums, Whitney Houston (1985)
                and Whitney (1987), both reached number one on the Billboard 200 in the United
                States, and to-date are the biggest-selling first two albums released of any artist
